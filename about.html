For thousands of years, people throughout Southeast Asia, and many other Asian countries, 
have been using fresh spices and natural ingredients for various healing benefits. 
They cook these ingredients using a slow and measured approach taking great care in the process. 
The art of cooking has become a philosophy � one that has been lost in the fast-paced nature of Western cultures. 
At Veda, we take Indian-inspired food to a whole new level with our healthy cooking approach and techniques.
We have adopted some techniques from the old philosophies and believe that cooking Indian food must 
be done slowly and deliberately. If another Indian restaurant tells you they just cooked your lentils from 
scratch and are serving them to you made-to-order, you might want to question them. It takes a long time to
 prepare Indian food and it must be done with passion. Since we�re a fast food and delivery service, 
 we have learned how to make all our curries in large batches and serve them only when they are fully 
 cooked meeting our strict quality standards.  We have analyzed our cooking times and processes to ensure 
 the proper preparation and cooking times, the same way you would cook for yourself at home. Our food is 
 always made from scratch with no
  preservatives or artificial flavors and most importantly, we have done all this and still been able to 
  completely remove the traditional ghee, heavy creams, and oils with trans fats, while maintaining our own 
  unique great flavors. With our natural ingredients and fresh-milled spices, you can enjoy a guilt-free meal 
  that is quick, easy, affordable, and delicious.
